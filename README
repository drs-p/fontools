This package provides tools to simplify using OpenType fonts with LaTeX.

Currently, this bundle contains the following programs:

AUTOINST - a wrapper script around Eddie Kohler's LCDF TypeTools. 
    Autoinst aims to automate the installation of OpenType fonts in LaTeX 
    by calling the LCDF TypeTools (with the correct options) for all fonts 
    you wish to install, and by generating the necessary .fd and .sty files.

AFM2AFM - re-encode .afm files

OT2KPX - extract kerning pairs from OpenType fonts.



PREREQUISITES
-------------

Perl

    The Fontools are written in Perl; any version since v5.10.1 should work.
    Perl is usually installed on Linux and Unix systems; 
    for Windows, try ActivePerl (http://www.activestate.com) 
    or Strawberry Perl (http://strawberryperl.com).

LCDF TypeTools
    Of course, Autoinst needs the LCDF TypeTools; 
    they should be installed in a directory on your PATH.

Kpathsea
    Automatically installing the fonts into a suitable TEXMF tree
    (as Autoinst does by default) requires a TeX-installation that uses 
    the kpathsea library; with TeX distributions that implement their 
    own directory searching (such as MiKTeX), Autoinst will complain that 
    it cannot find the kpsewhich program and install all generated files
    into subdirectories of the current directory. 
    
    If you use such a TeX distribution, either move these files to their 
    destinations by hand, or use the -target command line option
    (please see the manual for more information).

Other
    The encoding files in the "share" directory should be installed 
    in a standard location where otftotfm can find them.
